Details of my web development assignment

My web assignment contains four web pages (index.html, bio.html, cv.html and 
contact.html). Each web page contains a header, footer and a navigation bar.
In my home page, I have added a link to the css page using the link attribute.
UL and Li code is used to list the html pages (home, biography, CV, Contact).
Here I have presented the wire framing of my home page. 
 




In this home page a link to my Github homepage is given in the top left side of 
the page and image is on the top right of the page. The background color of my 
home page is pink. The header contains the violet color, the footer contains the 
orange color, the unordered list contains green color and the body contains the 
pink color. The footer contains the copyright text (copyright2017@shreztha) 
background color listed all of the above are same in all same in the all four 
web pages. The difference is only the content of body.

The next comes my biography page. Here is the wire framing of my biography 
page.

  

This biography page simply contains the plane text of my short biography, which 
is written about 300 words. This page tells about my past and the childhood 
memories and my educational background and my personal information.

Conclusion

This assignment of web development project toughs me the use of html5 and css. 
Throughout the time in working with this assignment I find many difficulties on 
finding the appropriate codes for my web page. I visited through my friends and 
teacher to get the idea on my assignment. I also visited website of 
www.w3schools.com and find it very helpful. I have used many of the attributes 
from this site. I worked for my assignment and completed it in 18 days. This 
report helps me to deal with the problems and obstacles in the real world.
