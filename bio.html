        <p><!--for paragraph-->
            My name is Ranjit shrestha.I was born in 4th July 1998 A.D in a small village.My birth place name is
            Godar(Dhanusha), which is located at the eastern part of my country(Nepal).I live in a single family.I
            have total 10 members in my family, incliding me, my five sisters,Mom,Dad and my grand parents.I started
            my school(pre-primary level) at the age of 4.It is located at my same village.My school name was Sita Vidya
            Ashram secondary english boarding  school.I used to have many childhood friends at school time.All of us were
            very friendly.We all used to go school at same time.Watching movies,playing cricket ,eating food items were
            some of the momorable moments of my childhood.Travelling to new destination,bike riding,playing games are
            some of my intrests.<br><br>

            I continued my secondary level at the same school.I passed my School Leaving Certificate[SLC] in 2014 A.D
            securing 72.38%.Now it was the time continue my study further.After I finished my secondary level,I came to
            Kathmandu(capital city) for my higher secondary education.To make my higher secondary education easy and
            convinent, I joined Bridge coures for 3 months till my SLC result published.After the long process of
            finding college,finally I was admitted to Capital College and Research Centre[CCRC] for my 10+2 education.
            Among the available subjects[Science,Management and Humanities] I have choosen Science for my higher
            secondary education.I want to become a computer engineer in future.To achicve my goal,I have studied so
            hard.After 2 years of studing at CCRC I gave my Higher Secondary Education Board [HSEB] Exam in 2016 A.D.
            Then I joined pre-engineering course at Progress Education Academy[PEA] located at Thapathali,kathmandu.
            Preparing for the pre-engineering coures was quite tough.Aroung 15000 students were participating for the same
            course and the available seats were only 432 at pulchok engineering campus[Government campus].<br><br><br>

            Then after waiting for 4 months my HSEB [Higher Secondary Education Board] exam result was published.
            I have obtained 71% in aggregrate.After that I begain to prepare for my pre-engineering entrance exam.
            I attend the entrance the entrance exam but the result was not good.I could't get listed among 432.I was
            very disappointed.I do not want to study in the non-government college in nepal.I want to study computer
            engineering in Pulchok engineering campus.One of my Physics teacher(Narendra Bista sir) in PEA told me about
            Nami college in a partnership with the university of Northampton.I went for the visit to the NAMI college.Nami
            college has been providing the world class degree in my own country.I observed the courses of the university
            of Northampton and found quite intresting.The courese of software engineering is very practical.I desided to
            study in this university and finally got admitted.Now I am studying at Nami college as a student of the
            university of Northampton with UN Id:-16418531.
